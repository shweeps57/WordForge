🔥 WordForge — ASCII Art Text Renderer in C

WordForge is a customizable ASCII-pattern generator written entirely in pure C, using manual 2D rendering logic, nested loops, and array manipulation.
It prints letters A–Z using pattern logic, supports horizontal and vertical modes, reverse printing, and dynamic sizing.

This project is perfect for:
	•	Working with 2D arrays
	•	Building shape-rendering algorithms
	•	Understanding terminal graphics in C
